# Hey, I’m Hichem 👋

Full-stack dev who enjoys building **useful tools**, breaking abstractions, and fixing DX pain points.  
Mostly working with **Laravel, React, TypeScript**, and **developer tooling**.

![Github states](https://github-readme-states.hichemtab-tech.me/api?username=HichemTab-tech&show=reviews,discussions_started,prs_merged,prs_merged_percentage&show_icons=true&theme=aura&text_color=00ff99&title_color=00ffff&bg_color=DEG,000000,444444&show_owner=true) <br>

I like projects that:
- remove boilerplate
- make APIs feel obvious
- save time for other devs (including future-me)

## Things I’m building / maintaining

- **project-registry** – a CLI & registry to manage and reuse project templates (local-first, no SaaS nonsense)
- **react-easy-loading** – simple, declarative loading states for React (no over-engineering)
- **react-shared-states** – global state as easy as `useState`, with async caching & scoping
- **Pomposer** – a smarter Composer wrapper with shared cache (pnpm vibes for PHP)
- **ts-runtime-picker** – runtime-safe object pickers driven by TypeScript types
- **LaravelFS** – full-stack Laravel starter kits via Composer

> I build things I actually want to use.
